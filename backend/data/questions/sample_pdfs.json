The weather has recently improved,\nand it is time to find out what effect the winter storms have had on their tree house\nand tents.\nThe winds at length were lulled, the sun shot his brilliant rays through the clouds, the rain\n\nceased to fall – spring had come. No prisoners set free could have felt more joy than we\ndid as we stepped out from our winter home. We refreshed our eyes with the pleasant\ngreenery around us, and our ears with the merry songs of a thousand happy birds, and\ndrank in the pure air of spring.\n\nOur tree house was our first care: filled with leaves and broken and torn by the wind, it\nlooked indeed dilapidated. We worked hard, and in a few days it was again habitable.\nI was anxious to visit the tent, for I feared that much of our precious stores might have\nsuffered. The damage done to Falconhurst was nothing compared to the scene that\nawaited us. The tent was blown to the ground, the canvas torn to rags, and the provisions\n\nsoaked. We immediately spread the things that we hoped to preserve in the sun to dry.\nThe irreparable damage we had suffered made me resolve to find some safer and more\nstable winter-quarters before the arrival of the next rainy season. Fritz proposed that we\nshould hollow out a cave in the rock. The difficulties such a task would present appeared\nalmost insurmountable, yet I was determined to make the attempt. We might not, I\n\nthought, cut out a cavern of sufficient size to serve as a room, but we might at least make\na cellar for the more valuable and perishable of our stores.\nSome days afterwards we left Falconhurst with the cart laden with a cargo of spades,\nhammers, chisels, pickaxes and crowbars, and began the work. On the smooth face of the\nrock I drew out in chalk the size of the proposed entrance, and then, with minds bent on\n\nsuccess, we battered away.\nSix days of hard and incessant toil made little impression; I do not think that the hole\nwould have been a satisfactory shelter for even our smallest dog.

An extract from ‘The Secret Garden’ At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing up-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees. She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either side. She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt. 5 “Eh! We’re on the moor now sure enough,” said Mrs. Medlock. The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them. A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound. “It’s—it’s not the sea, is it?” said Mary, looking round at her companion. 10 “No, not it,” answered Mrs. Medlock. “Nor it isn’t fields nor mountains, it’s just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep.” “I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,” said Mary. “It sounds like the sea just now.” 15 “That’s the wind blowing through the bushes,” Mrs. Medlock said. “It’s a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there’s plenty that likes it—particularly when the heather’s in bloom.” On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped, the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road went up and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Mary felt 20 as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land. “I don’t like it,” she said to herself. “I don’t like it,” and she pinched her thin lips more tightly together. by Frances Hodgson Burnett Circle the letter that matches the correct answer.",

      "text": "Jessica, Peter, Mohammed, Tanya and Becky are growing tomato plants. Each child has three seeds which can grow into plants. The children monitor their plants’ growth over two months. At the end of the two months Jessica has one plant which is much taller than her other two plants. Mohammed’s three plants are all healthy but much smaller than Jessica’s. Peter and Becky did not manage to grow plants from all of their seeds. Tanya only planted one seed, and saved the others for next year. At the end of two months, Tanya had the fewest plants. How many tomato plants did the children grow between them?",
