Which of these words is a verb? 4 An extract from \u2018The Secret Garden\u2019 At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing up-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees. She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either side. She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt. 5 \u201cEh! We\u2019re on the moor now sure enough,\u201d said Mrs. Medlock. The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them. A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not the sea, is it?\u201d said Mary, looking round at her companion. 10 \u201cNo, not it,\u201d answered Mrs. Medlock. \u201cNor it isn\u2019t fields nor mountains, it\u2019s just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep.\u201d \u201cI feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,\u201d said Mary. \u201cIt sounds like the sea just now.\u201d 15 \u201cThat\u2019s the wind blowing through the bushes,\u201d Mrs. Medlock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there\u2019s plenty that likes it\u2014particularly when the heather\u2019s in bloom.\u201d On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped, the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road went up and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Mary felt 20 as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d and she pinched her thin lips more tightly together. by Frances Hodgson Burnett",
