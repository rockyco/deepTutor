She turned it over and over, and thought about\n1.\nit. All she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she\ncould find out where the door was, she could perhaps open it and see what was inside the\nwalls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees. It was because it had been shut\nup so long that she wanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be different from other places\n5.\nand that something strange must have happened to it during ten years. Besides that, if she\nliked it she could go into it every day and shut the door behind her, and she could make\nup some play of her own and play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where\nshe was, but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. The\nthought of that pleased her very much.\n10.\nLiving in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever\nto do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually awakening\nher imagination.\nShe put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her path. No one but herself\never seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather,\n15.\nat the ivy growing on it. The ivy was the baffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked\nshe could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very much\ndisappointed as she paced the path and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed so\nsilly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in. She took the key in her\npocket when she went back to the house, and she made up her mind that she would\n20.\nalways carry it with her when she went out, so that if she ever should find the hidden door\nshe would be ready.\n* * *\nThe skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. The sun was shining and a little wind was\nblowing – not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a\nfresh scent of newly turned earth with it.\n25.\nMary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every few minutes. At\nlength she went to her own special path and made up her mind to try if she could skip the\nwhole length of it. It was a good long skip and she began slowly, but before she had gone\nhalf-way down the path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop. She\n \ndid not mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty. She stopped with a little\n30.\nlaugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy.\nHe had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him she\nfelt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she saw the\nrobin she laughed again.\n“You showed me where the key was yesterday,” she said. “You ought to show me the door\n35.\ntoday; but I don’t believe you know!”\nThe robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he opened\nhis beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off. Nothing in the world is quite as\nadorably lovely as a robin when he shows off – and they are nearly always doing it.\nOne of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the path, and it was a stronger one than\n40.\nthe rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees, and it was more than\nstrong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall. Mary\nhad stepped close to the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy\ntrails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand. This she did\nbecause she had seen something under it – a round knob which had been covered by the\n45.\nleaves hanging over it. It was the knob of a door.\nShe put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside. Thick as the\nivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain, though some had crept over wood\nand iron. Mary’s heart began to thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and\nexcitement. The robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side,\n50.\nas if he were as excited as she was. What was this under her hands which was square and\nmade of iron and which her fingers found a hole in?\nIt was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her\npocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it.\nIt took two hands to do it, but it did turn.\n55.\nAnd then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long path to see if anyone\nwas coming. No one was coming. No one ever did come, it seemed, and she took another\nlong breath, because she could not help it, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy\nand pushed back the door which opened slowly – slowly.\nThen she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it,\n60.\nlooking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.\nShe was standing inside the secret garden.\n \nCopyright © GL Assessment, 2017.\nAll rights reserved, including translation.

She turned it over and over, and thought about\n1.\nit. All she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she\ncould find out where the door was, she could perhaps open it and see what was inside the\nwalls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees. It was because it had been shut\nup so long that she wanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be different from other places\n5.\nand that something strange must have happened to it during ten years. Besides that, if she\nliked it she could go into it every day and shut the door behind her, and she could make\nup some play of her own and play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where\nshe was, but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. The\nthought of that pleased her very much.\n10.\nLiving in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever\nto do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually awakening\nher imagination.\nShe put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her path. No one but herself\never seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather,\n15.\nat the ivy growing on it. The ivy was the baffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked\nshe could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very much\ndisappointed as she paced the path and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed so\nsilly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in. She took the key in her\npocket when she went back to the house, and she made up her mind that she would\n20.\nalways carry it with her when she went out, so that if she ever should find the hidden door\nshe would be ready.\n* * *\nThe skipping-rope was a wonderful thing.

      "passage": "Read this passage carefully, then answer the questions that follow.\nThe Secret Garden\nby Frances Hodgson Burnett\nWhile walking in the garden Mary watched a robin and, after following it, discovered\na key on the ground.\nShe looked at the key quite a long time. She turned it over and over, and thought about\n1.\nit. All she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she\ncould find out where the door was, she could perhaps open it and see what was inside the\nwalls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees. It was because it had been shut\nup so long that she wanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be different from other places\n5.\nand that something strange must have happened to it during ten years. Besides that, if she\nliked it she could go into it every day and shut the door behind her, and she could make\nup some play of her own and play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where\nshe was, but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. The\nthought of that pleased her very much.\n10.\nLiving in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever\nto do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually awakening\nher imagination.\nShe put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her path. No one but herself\never seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather,\n15.\nat the ivy growing on it. The ivy was the baffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked\nshe could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very much\ndisappointed as she paced the path and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed so\nsilly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in. She took the key in her\npocket when she went back to the house, and she made up her mind that she would\n20.\nalways carry it with her when she went out, so that if she ever should find the hidden door\nshe would be ready.\n* * *\nThe skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. The sun was shining and a little wind was\nblowing – not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a\nfresh scent of newly turned earth with it.\n25.\nMary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every few minutes. At\nlength she went to her own special path and made up her mind to try if she could skip the\nwhole length of it. It was a good long skip and she began slowly, but before she had gone\nhalf-way down the path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop. She\n \ndid not mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty. She stopped with a little\n30.\nlaugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy.\nHe had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him she\nfelt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she saw the\nrobin she laughed again.\n“You showed me where the key was yesterday,” she said. “You ought to show me the door\n35.\ntoday; but I don’t believe you know!”\nThe robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he opened\nhis beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off. Nothing in the world is quite as\nadorably lovely as a robin when he shows off – and they are nearly always doing it.\nOne of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the path, and it was a stronger one than\n40.\nthe rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees, and it was more than\nstrong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall. Mary\nhad stepped close to the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy\ntrails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand. This she did\nbecause she had seen something under it – a round knob which had been covered by the\n45.\nleaves hanging over it. It was the knob of a door.\nShe put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside. Thick as the\nivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain, though some had crept over wood\nand iron. Mary’s heart began to thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and\nexcitement. The robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side,\n50.\nas if he were as excited as she was. What was this under her hands which was square and\nmade of iron and which her fingers found a hole in?\nIt was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her\npocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it.\nIt took two hands to do it, but it did turn.\n55.\nAnd then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long path to see if anyone\nwas coming. No one was coming. No one ever did come, it seemed, and she took another\nlong breath, because she could not help it, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy\nand pushed back the door which opened slowly – slowly.\nThen she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it,\n60.\nlooking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.\nShe was standing inside the secret garden.\n \nCopyright © GL Assessment, 2017.\nAll rights reserved, including translation.

She turned it over and over, and thought about\n1.\nit. All she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she\ncould find out where the door was, she could perhaps open it and see what was inside the\nwalls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees. It was because it had been shut\nup so long that she wanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be different from other places\n5.\nand that something strange must have happened to it during ten years. Besides that, if she\nliked it she could go into it every day and shut the door behind her, and she could make\nup some play of her own and play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where\nshe was, but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. The\nthought of that pleased her very much.\n10.\nLiving in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever\nto do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually awakening\nher imagination.\nShe put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her path. No one but herself\never seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather,\n15.\nat the ivy growing on it. The ivy was the baffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked\nshe could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very much\ndisappointed as she paced the path and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed so\nsilly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in. She took the key in her\npocket when she went back to the house, and she made up her mind that she would\n20.\nalways carry it with her when she went out, so that if she ever should find the hidden door\nshe would be ready.\n* * *\nThe skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. The sun was shining and a little wind was\nblowing – not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a\nfresh scent of newly turned earth with it.\n25.\nMary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every few minutes. At\nlength she went to her own special path and made up her mind to try if she could skip the\nwhole length of it. It was a good long skip and she began slowly, but before she had gone\nhalf-way down the path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop. She\n \ndid not mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty. She stopped with a little\n30.\nlaugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy.\nHe had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him she\nfelt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she saw the\nrobin she laughed again.\n“You showed me where the key was yesterday,” she said. “You ought to show me the door\n35.\ntoday; but I don’t believe you know!”\nThe robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he opened\nhis beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off. Nothing in the world is quite as\nadorably lovely as a robin when he shows off – and they are nearly always doing it.\nOne of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the path, and it was a stronger one than\n40.\nthe rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees, and it was more than\nstrong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall.

      "passage": "Read this passage carefully, then answer the questions that follow.\nThe Secret Garden\nby Frances Hodgson Burnett\nWhile walking in the garden Mary watched a robin and, after following it, discovered\na key on the ground.\nShe looked at the key quite a long time. She turned it over and over, and thought about\n1.\nit. All she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she\ncould find out where the door was, she could perhaps open it and see what was inside the\nwalls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees. It was because it had been shut\nup so long that she wanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be different from other places\n5.\nand that something strange must have happened to it during ten years. Besides that, if she\nliked it she could go into it every day and shut the door behind her, and she could make\nup some play of her own and play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where\nshe was, but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. The\nthought of that pleased her very much.\n10.\nLiving in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever\nto do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually awakening\nher imagination.\nShe put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her path. No one but herself\never seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather,\n15.\nat the ivy growing on it. The ivy was the baffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked\nshe could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very much\ndisappointed as she paced the path and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed so\nsilly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in. She took the key in her\npocket when she went back to the house, and she made up her mind that she would\n20.\nalways carry it with her when she went out, so that if she ever should find the hidden door\nshe would be ready.\n* * *\nThe skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. The sun was shining and a little wind was\nblowing – not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a\nfresh scent of newly turned earth with it.\n25.\nMary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every few minutes. At\nlength she went to her own special path and made up her mind to try if she could skip the\nwhole length of it. It was a good long skip and she began slowly, but before she had gone\nhalf-way down the path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop. She\n \ndid not mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty. She stopped with a little\n30.\nlaugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy.\nHe had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him she\nfelt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she saw the\nrobin she laughed again.\n“You showed me where the key was yesterday,” she said. “You ought to show me the door\n35.\ntoday; but I don’t believe you know!”\nThe robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he opened\nhis beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off. Nothing in the world is quite as\nadorably lovely as a robin when he shows off – and they are nearly always doing it.\nOne of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the path, and it was a stronger one than\n40.\nthe rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees, and it was more than\nstrong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall. Mary\nhad stepped close to the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy\ntrails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand. This she did\nbecause she had seen something under it – a round knob which had been covered by the\n45.\nleaves hanging over it. It was the knob of a door.\nShe put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside. Thick as the\nivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain, though some had crept over wood\nand iron. Mary’s heart began to thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and\nexcitement. The robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side,\n50.\nas if he were as excited as she was. What was this under her hands which was square and\nmade of iron and which her fingers found a hole in?\nIt was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her\npocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it.\nIt took two hands to do it, but it did turn.\n55.\nAnd then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long path to see if anyone\nwas coming.

The codes are not written in the same order as the words and one code is missing. NAIL FIND LATE FIST 3752 5674 4689 which letter. Begin by focusing on one number which appears more than once. If this number appears in the same position in two of the codes, you might be able to spot the same pattern with the letters. If not, compare the positions of your chosen letter and see if this is reflected in the words. For example, the number 7 appears in 2nd position in the first code (3752) and 3rd position in the second code (5674). Looking at the 2nd letters of the words, I is the one letter that also appears in 3rd position in a word, so the letter I must be represented by the number 7 and so on. Once we’ve substituted these letters into the remaining number codes, we can work out what a few more numbers stand for. Knowing that 4=L (from NAIL), we can tell that 4689 stands for LATE and, therefore, that 8=T and 9=E. Looking at the third and final number code, 3752, we can conclude that 3=F because the two remaining words both begin with F.

For example the number 6 appears twice across the number codes: once in 4th position and once in 3rd position. The only letter this can be is L, so we can conclude 6=L. In this way, we build up our key and can provide the code for any word and, conversely, the word for any code, depending on what the question is asking.
