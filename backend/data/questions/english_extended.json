        "passage": "The rainforest is often called the 'lungs of the Earth' because it produces a significant amount of the world's oxygen. These dense forests, found mainly near the equator, are home to more than half of all plant and animal species on our planet. However, deforestation threatens this vital ecosystem. Every year, an area roughly the size of a small country is destroyed for farming, logging, and development. Scientists warn that if this continues, many species could become extinct, and the effects on our climate could be devastating.",
