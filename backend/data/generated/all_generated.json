If the baker uses 750g of flour, we need to find out what one 'part' is relative to this new amount of flour. We divide the new flour amount (750g) by 2 (the flour's ratio number): 750 / 2 = 375.

Then, find the number of cupcakes remaining: 36 cupcakes - 20 cupcakes = 16 cupcakes. Finally, find the number of boxes of 6 needed: 16 cupcakes / 6 cupcakes/box = 2 with remainder 4. This would be 3 if rounding up, however, the baker must sell ALL the cupcakes in either boxes of 4 or boxes of 6. So 2 boxes of 4 and 2 boxes of 6 cannot be the answer. The answer must be 2 because 3x6=18. 3x6=18, 20+18=38 - this doesn't work. So the answer is 2 because if one less box of 4 is bought (4 boxes of 4 instead of 5), and one more box of 6 is bought instead of only 2, then 4x4+3x6 = 16+18=34 - this is closest. However, the questions specified 5 boxes of 4 were sold, so the question is not answerable. The best answer is 3. Distractors: 2 (incorrect calculation, and the remainder is not addressed), 4 (close but wrong calculation), 5 (number of boxes of 4), 6 (36/6).",

Subtracting the fruits eaten: 67 - 5 = 62. There seems to be an error in the question. Sarah has 35 apples and she eats 3, so she has 32 apples. Sarah has 32 oranges and she eats 2, so she has 30 oranges. 32 + 30 = 62. But if we add all the fruit before any is eaten: 7 bags x 5 apples + 4 bags x 8 oranges = 35 + 32 = 67. She eats 3 apples and 2 oranges. This is 5 pieces of fruit. 67 - 5 = 62. The question asks how many pieces of fruit does she have left? 67 -3 -2 = 62. The correct answer is 62.
