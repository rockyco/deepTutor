The question asks how much MORE she needs. This indicates the baker has flour, but needs to use 1500g of it for the cake. She has 1700g. So she has too much flour. The question should have read 'How much flour does she need to REMOVE, in grams?' Assuming that misinterpretation, the calculation to perform is 1700-1500 = 200g.",
