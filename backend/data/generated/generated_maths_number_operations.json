Then, find the number of cupcakes remaining: 36 cupcakes - 20 cupcakes = 16 cupcakes. Finally, find the number of boxes of 6 needed: 16 cupcakes / 6 cupcakes/box = 2 with remainder 4. This would be 3 if rounding up, however, the baker must sell ALL the cupcakes in either boxes of 4 or boxes of 6. So 2 boxes of 4 and 2 boxes of 6 cannot be the answer. The answer must be 2 because 3x6=18. 3x6=18, 20+18=38 - this doesn't work. So the answer is 2 because if one less box of 4 is bought (4 boxes of 4 instead of 5), and one more box of 6 is bought instead of only 2, then 4x4+3x6 = 16+18=34 - this is closest. However, the questions specified 5 boxes of 4 were sold, so the question is not answerable. The best answer is 3.
